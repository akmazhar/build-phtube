         <h1 class="title text-red-500">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h1>
          
            <h3 class=" text-blue-500">`var`, `let`, and `const` are all keywords used for declaring variables in JavaScript. Each of these keywords has a different scope and behavior when it comes to variable declaration and assignment.</h3>
            <p class="mr-8 ml-8 mt-2 text-black-500">
                <P>1. <b>**var**:</b>
                    <br>Scope: Function-scoped or globally scoped, depending on whether it's declared inside a function or at the top level of a script.

                   <P> Hoisting: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means you can use a variable before it's declared, but it will have an initial
                    value of `undefined`.</P>

                    <P>Re-declaration: Variables declared with `var` can be re-declared within the same scope without any error.</P>
                <br>
                <img class="image-full ml-40" src="./image/9.jpg" alt="">
                <P>2. <b>**let**:</b>
                    <br>Scope: Block-scoped, meaning it's limited to the block in which it's defined, such as loops, conditionals, or functions.
                 <P>  Hoisting: Like `var`, `let` declarations are hoisted, but they are not initialized. Get a `ReferenceError`  try to access a `let` variable before its declaration.</P>
                <P>Re-declaration: It cannot re-declare a variable with `let` in the same scope. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error.</P>
                <br>
                <P>3. <b>**const**:</b>
                    <br>Scope: Like `let`, `const` is block-scoped and limited to the block in which it's defined.
                    <P>Hoisting: Similar to `let`, `const` declarations are hoisted but not initialized.</P>
                <P>    Re-declaration: It cannot re-declare or reassign a variable declared with `const`. It's intended for creating variables that won't change their value after initialization.
                    Value Assignment: Variables declared with `const` must be assigned a value when they are declared and cannot be left uninitialized.</P>

              <h1 class="title text-red-500">•	Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h1>
              <img class="image" src="./image/js1.jpeg" alt=""><h3 class=" text-blue-500">Null is used when we want to show any variable's missing or unknown value. At the same time, Undefined is a predefined Javascript type assigned to a variable or object that has not been assigned.</h3>
                
                
                <p class="mr-8 ml-8 mt-2 text-black-500">
                    <P>1. <b>**Undefined:**:</b>
                        <br><P>Default Value: When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is automatically initialized to "undefined" in many programming languages.</P>
                        <P>Missing Property: When trying to access a property that doesn't exist in an object, it often results in "undefined."</P>
                        <P>Function Return: If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns "undefined."</P>
                        <P>Function Parameters: If a function is called with fewer arguments than its parameter count, the remaining parameters are assigned the value "undefined."</P>
                        <P>Index Out of Bounds: In arrays, attempting to access an index that is out of bounds will yield "undefined."</P>
                        <P>Callback Functions: If a callback function is expected to have a return value but doesn't, the result might be "undefined."</P>
                     </P>
                    <br>
                  
                    <P>2. <b>**Null**:</b></P>
                        <br><P>Explicit Absence of Value: Unlike "undefined," which usually indicates a lack of assignment or presence, "null" is used to explicitly represent the absence of any meaningful value.</P>
                        <P>Initializing Variables: Sometimes, you might intentionally initialize a variable with the value "null" to indicate that it hasn't been assigned a valid value yet.</P>
                        <P>Resetting Values: You can assign "null" to a variable or property to indicate that it should no longer hold a valid value or reference.</P>
                        <P>Checking for Existence: When a variable might or might not hold a value, you can compare it to "null" to determine whether a meaningful value has been assigned.</P>
                    
                    
                    <P><br>In summary, "undefined" is often used to indicate situations where a value is missing due to default behavior or improper access, while "null" is employed when you want to explicitly represent the absence of a value, often in a controlled and intentional manner. The specific use cases can vary between programming languages, but the general concepts remain consistent.</P>

          <h1 class="title text-red-500">•	What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
           <div class="image"><img class="center" src="./image/fd.png" alt="" width="250px" height="200px"></div>
            <br>
            <h3 class=" text-blue-500">An API, short for application programming interface, establishes rules for connections and communication between applications or devices. A REST API follows the principles of the REST architectural style, governing how data interactions occur.</h3>
            <p class="mr-8 ml-8 mt-2 text-black-500">
                <P>REST APIs use HTTP requests for standard database actions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (CRUD operations) within a resource. For instance, a GET request fetches data, POST creates, PUT updates, and DELETE removes records. All HTTP methods are applicable. A well-crafted REST API resembles a browser-loaded website with inherent HTTP capabilities.
                    
                <br>The current state of a resource is its representation, deliverable in various formats like JSON, HTML, etc. JSON is popular for its human and machine readability, being language-independent.
                    
                <br>Request headers and parameters play a vital role in REST API calls, holding identifiers, metadata, authorizations, URIs, cookies, etc. These, coupled with response headers and HTTP status codes, constitute a strong REST API design.</P>
